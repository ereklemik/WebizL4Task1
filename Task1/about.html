            <h2>More than just a record label</h2>
            <p>Launched in 2017, Cactus Jack Records was created as a way for Travis to help emerging artists. “I’m not doing it to have financial control over my music,” the rapper told Numéro in an interview at the time of its launch. “I want first and foremost to help other artists, launch new names, to provide opportunities. I want to do for them what happened to me, but better. By better, I mean no bullshit. No lying to the artists about album release dates or budgets of videos and albums.” 

                Although Travis alluded to a collective album during his Zane Lowe interview earlier this year, he’s been relatively quiet about what they’ve been cooking up for fans. The most we’ve heard about the group came during his Netflix’s documentary, Look Mom, I Can Fly, which briefly delved into Sheck Wes and Don Toliver’s creative processes. Despite initial reports, Smokepurpp is not signed to Cactus Jack, a publicist for the label confirms to Complex.</p> </section>
